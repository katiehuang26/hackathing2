# Hack-a-thing 2
## Katie Huang, CS 98

Unity project that follows the Unity 2D Creator Kit: RPG project tutorial 
[here](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-with-the-creator-kit-rpg?projectId=5ccc189dedbc2a3ae01f0c0e&signup=true&uv=2020.3)

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I followed the tutorial to create a 2D map area with various terrain, a building with an 
animated fade-in effect when entered, and a questline dialogue to find a golden apple.

I added my own touch with some unique on-screen prompts and dialogue branches to the quest, 
as well as designing the layout. 

### References
I didn't use any other references.

## What you learned
- I really enjoyed the GUI for Unity. It made laying out the terrain like drawing using a 
palette of pre-made assets. It was simple to learn and I could get right down to designing 
the map and not thinking about minutae.  
- Coding knowledge made the process seem much more intuitive, although I'm sure that it's 
easy enough to understand without a coding background. 
- Objects in Unity are called "prefabs", and the prefabs are organized in parent-child hierarchies.
- Objects in Unity also have components and, to me, some of them seemed similar to events 
in Javascript, such as "trigger X when colliding" 
- I've wanted to make a game in the past and I always stopped myself from even starting by 
getting hung up on basic engine problems like collision detection, the separation of 
background/foreground, animations, etc., but Unity makes it easy to forget about that and I 
appreciated that.

## What didnâ€™t work
- Overall went much smoother than hack-a-thing 1. 
- I had a few minor bugs when setting up the project and had to recreate it, but luckily I 
didn't lose much progress.
